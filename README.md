# Product’s Color Can Affect the Product’s Price and Customer Behaviors
One of the essential questions that appear when a product owner wants to launch a product or who has markets and wants to buy products to sell is the suitable color that could be used or bought? Can product colors determine the product cost and the customer's decisions? Anyone who works in the marketing or sale department can tell how product color is an essential factor affecting customer behavior. However, some details need some analytics to be answered, such as, if the product has more than one color, will this affect the customer's actions? What are the most men, women, kid's products colors? If there is a product with several colors, will this influence customer reviews? Analyzing how colors can affect consumers' behavior will provide a good idea to those seeking to sell many products and gain profits. Although the designers working on creating the product details know how important to pick the right color for each piece of the product, knowing how the color can influence the product price and people's desires will help the decision-maker make the right decisions.
This project will try to answer this kind of question by examining the hypothesis that says, "product's color can affect the product's price and customer behaviors." In addition, answering these questions needs to consider many factors, such as the target audiences and the product nature.
